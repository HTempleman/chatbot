# chatbot
A restful chatbot that was built using React.js, AWS Lex, Docker, and the Node.js Loopback Framework


This code was recently transferred from a privete repo on Bitbucket with some senstive information hastily modified/removed. 
Instructions on usage and installation are forthcoming. 

OTTOMY Head Instructions:
1) Make sure that you have docker installed and your permissions are set up correctly.
2) Within the loopback-chatbot directory, run npm install.
3) From here, I've made a BASH script that should help you to forgo the tedium of building the webpack bundle and containerizing
everything. Give the botmanager script execution permissions and try running the following: "./botmanager development"
4) That should do it, hopefully you'll have a local instance of the chatbot running. If you don't, blame it on me. I will update 
the readme with more useful instructions when I'm not so low on sleep...
