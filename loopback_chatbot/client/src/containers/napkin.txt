Problem: 
        The scroll component is being called at inopportune times, such as when a message is being typed out but not yet completed. 
        This results in the scroll bar only partially focused on the incoming text from the BOT.

Solution: 
        Maybe you can throw some boolean values around that can refine the calls on the scroll component.
